## 📌 Project Proposal

Many habit trackers focus on productivity but lack emotional warmth and user delight. HabitSpark makes habit-building feel fun, cozy, and meaningful by giving users a Habit Buddy, pastel rewards, and meaningful feedback — like mood tracking, habit categories, and unlockable features.

Users can create an account, track habits privately, and build up a collection of completions that help grow their pet companion. Each user's data is completely separate.
